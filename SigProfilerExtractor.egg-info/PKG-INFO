        # SigProfilerExtractor
        SigProfilerExtractor allows de novo extraction of mutational signatures from data generated in a matrix format. 
        The tool identifies the number of operative mutational signatures, their activities in each sample, and the probability 
        for each signature to cause a specific mutation type in a cancer sample. The tool makes use of SigProfilerMatrixGenerator 
        and SigProfilerPlotting. 
        
        ## INSTALLATION
        In the commandline, please type the following line:
        ```
        $pip install SigProfilerExtractor
        ```
        Install your desired reference genome from the command line/terminal as follows (available reference genomes are: GRCh37, GRCh38, mm9, and mm10):
        ```
        $ python
        >> from SigProfilerMatrixGenerator import install as genInstall
        >> genInstall.install('GRCh37')
        ```
        This will install the human 37 assembly as a reference genome. You may install as many genomes as you wish.
        
        open a python interpreter and import the SigProfilerExtractor module. Please see the examples of the functions. 
        
        ## FUNCTIONS
        
        ### importdata 
            
            
            Imports the path of example data.
            
            importdata(datatype="matrix")
        
            Example: 
            -------
            >>> from SigProfilerExtractor import sigpro as sig
            >>> path_to_example_table = sig.importdata("matrix")
            >>> data = path_to_example_table 
            This "data" variable can be used as a parameter of the "project" argument of the sigProfilerExtractor function.
            
            To get help on the parameters and outputs of the "importdata" function, please write down the following line:
            
            >>> help(sig.importdata)
                
        
        ### sigProfilerExtractor 
            
            
        Extracts mutational signatures from an array of samples.
        
        sigProfilerExtractor(input_type, out_put, input_data, refgen="GRCh37", genome_build = 'GRCh37', startProcess=1,             endProcess=10, totalIterations=100, init="alexandrov-lab-custom", cpu=-1,  mtype = "default",exome = False,                 penalty=0.05, resample = True, wall= False, gpu=False)
        
        
        
        **input_type:** A string. Type of input. The type of input should be one of the following:
                - "vcf": used for vcf format inputs.
                - "matrix": used for table format inputs using a tab seperated file.
        
        
        **out_put:** A string. The name of the output folder. The output folder will be generated in the current working                directory. 
        
        **input_data:** A string. Name of the input folder (in case of "vcf" type input) or the input file (in case of "matrix"          type input). The project file or folder should be inside the current working directory. For the "vcf" type                  input,the project has to be a folder which will contain the vcf files in vcf format or text formats.The "matrix"            type projects have to be a file.   
        
        **refgen:** A string, optional. The name of the reference genome. The default reference genome is "GRCh37". This                parameter is applicable only if the input_type is "vcf".
        
        **startProcess:** A positive integer, optional. The minimum number of signatures to be extracted. The default value              is 1 
        
        **endProcess:** A positive integer, optional. The maximum number of signatures to be extracted. The default value is 10
        
        **totalIterations:** A positive integer, optional. The number of iteration to be performed to extract each number                signature. The default value is 100
        
        **init:** A String. The initialization algorithm for W and H matrix of NMF. Options are "alexandrov-lab-custom",                "nndsvd", nndsvda", "nndsvdar". 
        
        **wall:** A Boolean. If true, the Ws and Hs from all the NMF iterations are generated in the output. 
        
        **cpu:** An integer, optional. The number of processors to be used to extract the signatures. The default value is -1            which will use all available processors. 
        
        **mtype:** A string, optional. The items in the list defines the mutational contexts to be considered to extract the             signatures. The default value is "96,DBS,ID", where "96" is the SBS96 context, "DBS"
              is the DINULEOTIDE context and ID is INDEL context. 
        
        **exome:** Boolean, optional. Defines if the exomes will be extracted. The default value is "False".
        
        **penalty:** Float, optional. Takes any positive float. Default is 0.05. Defines the thresh-hold cutoff to asaign                signatures to a sample.    
        
        **resample:** Boolean, optional. Default is True. If True, add poisson noise to samples by resampling.

        ### GPU support
        
        Sigprofilerextractor is GPU-enabled and can run on single or multi-GPU systems for significantly increased performance in most circumstances.
        
        To use this feature set the GPU flag to True:
        ```
            sigProfilerExtractor(input_type, out_put, project, refgen="GRCh37", genome_build = "GRCh37", startProcess=1, endProcess=10, totalIterations=100, 
            cpu=-1, exome = False, gpu=True)
        ```
        If CUDA out of memory exceptions occur, it will be necessary to reduce the number of CPU processes used (the `cpu` parameter).
